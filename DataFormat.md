# Data Preparation Guidelines

When working with your dataset, it's important to follow these data preparation guidelines to ensure the data is suitable for analysis and modeling:

## 1. Data Type Restriction
Ensure that the dataset consists only of numerical and categorical features. This step helps maintain data type consistency, making it easier to apply machine learning algorithms.

## 2. Missing Value Handling
Take steps to eliminate missing values from the dataset. You can employ various strategies, such as imputation or removal of rows or columns, to ensure that no missing values are present in the dataset.

## 3. Unique Identifier Removal
Remove columns that contain unique values, such as names or identification numbers. These columns often do not contribute to the predictive modeling process and can be safely excluded from the analysis.

## 4. Categorical Output Variable
If your dataset includes an output variable (target), ensure that it is categorical in nature. If the output variable is initially numerical, consider converting it into a categorical variable if it better suits the problem you are trying to solve.

By following these guidelines, you can better prepare your data for analysis and modeling, setting the stage for more effective and accurate results.
